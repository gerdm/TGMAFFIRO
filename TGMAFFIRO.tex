\chapter{Financial Markets}
Throughout modern history, the value of \textit{anything} has been of great importance. In order to set the value of exchange in a transaction, any two parties involved must agree in the current worth of whatever it is that will be transacted, and take opposite sides of interest in it\footnote{In other words, one party wants to buy (obtain) and the other to sell (get rid off)}. Furthermore, these two parties require to communicate, and be able to find one another or a third whose worth of the \textit{something} at play favors any one of them more.\\

A \textbf{security}, is the epitome of a tradable object in financial markets. We define a security as an instrument that either represents ownership or that derives its value from a commodity. We say that a security is \textbf{fungible} if any unit of the instrument is economically indistinguishable from all other units. That is, whomever buys (or sells) the instrument can pay (or receive) any unit at the same price at a given point in time.\\

The problem of searching for the price and the party whose view on the value of a security reflect ours is called \textbf{trading}. A \textbf{market} is the place where buyers meet sellers. Markets can be both a physical place (called a trading floor), or an electronic system.\\

Not all financial products are traded in formal markets. Over the counter (OTC) trades happen between two parties directly or via a broker, whom helps them settle the trade. 

\section{The Participants}
In a financial market, participants have various reasons to trade. On the one hand there is the \textbf{buy-side}. They trade in order to solve a financial problem originated outside of the market. This group sees the market as a means to an end, and thus, they rely on the resources available in the market.\\

\end{table}


 On the other hand are the participants who offer exchange services to the buy-side. Their trading purpose is to satisfy the needs of the buy-side by taking the opposite side of the trade. This group sells exchange services to the buy-side, consequently they are known as the \textbf{sell-side}.\\

\begin{table}[h!]

    	\hline

    	\hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Sell-side of the market. \aycite{harris}}
\end{table}

We can classify the buy-side and the sell-side as those who require liquidity and as those who provide it. \textbf{Liquidity} is an important concept in financial markets. Although the term itself can be regarded in many ways, we will denote it as the likelihood of trading constraint to units available, price offered and time.

\section{The Instruments}
Financial instruments comprise a wide array of products. Each one of these serve a purpose to either the buy-side or the sell-side. We will review briefly the instruments that will serve for the development of this work.

\subsection{Bonds}

According to the SEC,
\begin{displayquote}
``A bond is a debt obligation, like an IOU. Investors who buy corporate bonds are lending money to the company issuing the bond. In return, the company makes a legal commitment to pay interest on the principal and, in most cases, to return the principal when the bond comes due, or matures.''
\end{displayquote}

Bond can be issued either by a corporation or by a government. Its main function is to raise capital for the issuer of the bond, known as the \textbf{debtor}, who promises a payment to the buyer of the bond, or as the \textbf{creditor} or the \textbf{bondholder}. The amount of money to be paid at the time of maturity is the \textbf{nominal value} or the \textbf{principal} of the bond.\\

In addition, bonds may or may not pay an interest on the nominal of the bond. In the former case, this is known as a \textbf{coupon bearing bond}, while the latter is referred to as the \textbf{zero coupon bond}.

\subsection{Stocks}
A stock is a security that represents ownership on a fraction of a corporation; it is a proportional division of a company's assets and distributed through what is known as a \textbf{dividend}. Future dividends are generally not known in advance. This contrast a big difference between bonds and stocks, while the former has a predefined number of payments, the latter is uncertain in amount and frequency.

\subsection{Foreign Exchange Currencies}
\aycite{kozy} defines a foreign currency as ``one country's currency freely convertible in the foreign exchange market''.\\

The foreign exchange market is an OTC market where buyers and sellers get together to buy and sell foreign currencies or financial contracts on said currencies. The foreign exchange market is also known as the \textit{FX market}.

\subsection{Derivatives}
Derivatives are the main topic in this work. \aycite{hull} defines derivatives as ``as a financial instrument whose value depends on (or derives from) the values of other, more basic, underlying variables''. This definition leaves room for many possible products that can depend on more than one factor.\\

Derivatives are mainly used to hedge and/or arbitrage. We can categorize them into two main categories: listed and OTC contracts. Listed contracts can be bought or sold in an organized market. These are standardized products that can be traded in financial markets. OTC contracts, on the other hand, represent a contract between two parties without the need of a market for the two parties to meet.

\section{Risk: Hedging and Arbitrage}
Risk is an inherent aspect of financial markets. For bonds, for example, risk is represented as the plausibility of default for the government or the company which issued the asset. For stocks, risk is presented as uncertainty of future prices, whether the company goes bankrupt, or the amount of the future dividend to be payed.\\

From a financial institution's perspective interested in selling derivative contracts, their intention may not be to speculate with the products they sell, as to where the price of the contracts may go, but rather to sell this a service. This forces the financial institution to eliminate all possible risk associated with the contract. Furthermore, the price they sell this contract for must be such that no one else may take a riskless profit from it.\\

Two important concepts emerge for a financial institution interested in covering the needs of the sell-side. That of \textbf{hedging} and \textbf{arbitrage}. Although we will define it more rigourously in upcoming chapters, the following will motivate the idea of what we want to achieve\\

 Consider the following example. Suppose we are bank willing to sell a stock three months from now. Since we do not know the price the stock will take three months from now and we are not interested in taking risk selling this \textit{derivative}, we wrongly decide to price this derivative as the current price of the stock plus an arbitrary fee, thus allowing us to deliver the stock three months from now and get a profit from it.\\
 
 One clever trader realizes that he can borrow, for three months, the current price of the stock, buy the stock, and pay the interested the bank imposes plus the nominal three months from now. If the value of the nominal plus interest is greater than the price for which the bank is selling this derivative, the trader can short-sell the stock, invest the amount received and enter the contract.\\
 
  Three months from now the trader must pay the price of the contract, which he can do since the amount he invested in the bank is greater than the price of the contract. Also, he can return the stock he shorted since the bank will give it to him, thus making a riskless profit.\\
 
Although the bank decided cover its position in order to fulfill its future obligation, the price it gave the contract was such that the trader made a profit without taking any risk from it. Strictly speaking, the bank \textbf{hedged} its position and the trader made an \textbf{arbitrage}.\\

This simple example presents the key ideas to take account whenever we try to price any derivative. By replicating what the trader did, the bank would be hedged and would not incur in anyone making an arbitrage. Composing an effective hedge may not be so easy for every contract. Consider a derivative that provides to the buyer the option to buy a stock at a future date and at a predetermined price. What we would like is to know the present value of this derivative, known as as the premium, such that it allow us for an effective hedge and prevent anyone from making an arbitrage.\\

At maturity date, the payoff for the option will be

\begin{equation}
	\max\{S-K, 0\}
\end{equation}

This contract is known as an European Option.

The knowledge and tools we currently have can only take us so far as to know the price for this derivative. For us to effectively price this \textbf{option}, we will need tools to explain the random movements of stocks in pursuance of the desired premium.

\section{Measurable Spaces}
\newtheorem{definition}{Definition}[chapter]
\newtheorem{remark}{Remark}[chapter]

\begin{definition}{\textbf{Algebra}}
	Let $\Omega$ be a set of points $\omega$. A system $\mathscr{A}$ of subsets of $\Omega$ is an Algebra if:
	\begin{enumerate}[I.]
		\item $\Omega \in \mathscr{A}$
		\item If $A, B \in \mathscr{A} \Rightarrow A \cap B \in \mathscr{A}$
		\item If $A \in \mathscr{A} \Rightarrow A^\mathsf{c} \in \mathscr{F}$
	\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}{\textbf{$\sigma$-algebra}}\label{salgebra}
	A system $\mathscr{F}$ of subsets of $\Omega$ is a $\sigma$-algebra if it is an algebra and it satisfies one additional condition:
	\begin{equation*}
		\text{If } \{A_n\}_{n\geq 1} \in \mathscr{F} \Rightarrow \bigcup_{k=1}^{\infty} A_k \in \mathscr{F} 
	\end{equation*}
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
	for $\{A_n\}_{n\geq 1} \in \mathscr{F}$ then, definition \ref{salgebra} is equivalent to say that
	\begin{equation*}
		\text{If } \{A_n\}_{n\geq 1} \in \mathscr{F} \Rightarrow \bigcap_{k=1}^{\infty} A_k \in \mathscr{F}
	\end{equation*}
\end{remark}

\begin{proof}
	By the generalized form of De Morgan's laws, $(\bigcap_k A_k)^\mathsf{c} \equiv \bigcup_k A_k^\mathsf{c}$. Since $A_k \in \mathscr{F} \ \forall \ k$ then, by definition,  $A_k^\mathsf{c} \in \mathscr{F} \ \forall \ k$ which implies  $\bigcup_k A_k^\mathsf{c}$ and this complement is also in $\mathscr{F}$
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}{\textbf{Measurable Space}}
	If $\mathscr{F}$ is a $\sigma$-algebra of subsets of $\Omega$, $(\Omega, \mathscr{F})$ is said to be a measurable space. If $A$ is a set in $\mathscr{F}$, we say that $A$ is $\mathscr{F}$-measurable (or measurable w.r.t. $\mathscr{F}$)
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}{\textbf{Measure}}
	Let $\bar{\mathbb R} := \mathbb R \cup \{-\infty, \infty\}$ be the extended real line and let $(\Omega, \mathscr{F})$ be a measurable space. t is said that a function $\mu: \mathscr{F} \rightarrow \bar{\mathbb R}$ is a measure over $(\Omega, \mathscr{F})$ if
	\begin{enumerate}[I.]
		\item $\mu(\emptyset) = 0$
		\item $\mu(A) \geq 0\ \forall \ A \in \mathscr{F} $
		\item $\mu$ is $\sigma$-additive: If $\{A_k\}_{k=1}^{\infty}$ is a set of disjoint events in $\mathscr{F}$ ($A_i \cap A_j = \emptyset \ \forall \ i \neq j$), 
		\begin{equation*}
			\bigcup_{k=1}^{\infty} \mu(A_k) = \mu(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} A_k)
		\end{equation*}
	\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

If this last definition holds true then, $(\Omega, \mathscr{F}, \mu)$ is said to be a \textbf{measure space}. $\mu(A)$ is the measure of $A\in\mathscr{F}$. Furthermore, if $\mu(\Omega) < \infty$ then, $\mu$ is said to be a finite measure. Lastly, if  $\mu(\Omega) = 1$ then, $\mu$ is said to be a probability.\\

If $\mu$ is a probability then, $\mu \equiv \mathbb{P}$ is said to be a probability space. We can formalize this definition as follows:

\begin{definition}{\textbf{Kolmogorov's Axiom System}}
	An ordered triple $(\Omega, \mathscr{F}, \mathbb{P})$ where
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $\Omega$ is a set of points $\omega$
		\item $\mathscr{F}$ is a $\sigma$-algebra of subsets of $\Omega$
		\item $\mathbb P$ is a probability on $\mathscr{F}$
	\end{itemize}
	is called a \textbf{probability space} or \textbf{model} (of an experiment)
